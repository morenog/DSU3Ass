# Data Science Specialisation, Unit 3 - Getting and Cleaning Data - Assignment

This README.md file conatins information explaining the contents of this repo and how the scripts function.

This repo contains the Assignment work for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course.

## Assignment Description
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to, from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

### Assignment Tasks
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Notes
- Only one scriptfile has been generated **run_analysis.R**
- The scriptfile assumes that all the data is stored in a child directory structure under the current R working directory.
- When extracting files from the data zip file, a directory /UCI HAR Dataset should be created in your working directory, coantaing sub directories and files.
- A **tidydata.txt** file will be generated as the final output of the script.  This will be created in the R working directory.
- The scriptfile calls the required packages.
